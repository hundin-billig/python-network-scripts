# python-network-scripts
This is a repository of scripts in the Python language. These were built during various classes I was enrolled in while continuing my education. Most of these are rudimentary at the moment, and may
stay that way unless I modify them for other purposes. The scripts are meant to showcase what I was learning with hands on programming instruction. Do not scan any networks that you do not have permission to scan....you can be held liable for breaking any civil, state, or national laws against hacking.
